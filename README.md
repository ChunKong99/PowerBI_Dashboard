# Recommendations
1)  Trend of data job ads in 2024 is down.
-   This shows that the trend will likely continue into 2025.
-   Data analyst job applicants should have urgency when applying jobs as job supply decreases.

2)  Top job ad provider is LinkedIn.
-   As the dataset includes all jobs from multiple countries, this conclusion may not be the same when looking at only Malaysia.
-   Data analyst jobs applicants should explore LinkedIn as main job ad provider, especially for fully remote jobs.

3)  Total job ads for Data Engineer, Data Analyst, and Data Scientist are higher than other data roles.
-   This shows higher demand for these 3 roles as compared to other data roles like Business Analyst and Cloud Engineer.
-   Coupled with general down trend of all data job ads in 2024, roles like Business Analyst and Cloud Engineer contributes more to reduction in job ads.

3)  Median salary for Data Analyst is lowest.
-   Job applicants should take note that low median salary of Data Analyst with relatively higher amounts of job ads suggests high availability of job applicants (employers' market).
